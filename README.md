This dataset provides you a taste of working on data sets from insurance companies â€“ what challenges are faced there, what strategies are used, which variables influence the outcome, etc. This is a classification problem. 

The aim is to predict if a loan will get approved or not.

Packages like numpy, pandas and sklearn have been used extensively. Different models such as logistic regression, decision tree and random forest have been used with multiple combination of variables. Random forest outperformed other models. Six most important features have been found out and then grid search has been used to tune the parameters of random forest model with these six most important features to further improve the results.
